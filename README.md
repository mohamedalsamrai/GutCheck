## Configuration

### App Icons
Replace `gutcheck.png` in the root directory with your icon (minimum 1024×1024px), then regenerate:
```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

### Localization
Add new translations in `lib/l10n/` YAML files and rebuild to generate localized strings.

### Database
Isar models are in `lib/core/models/`. After modifying, regenerate:
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes and test**
   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   flutter test
   ```

3. **Format code**
   ```bash
   dart format lib/ test/
   ```

4. **Commit and push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description of changes"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**

## Known Issues & Limitations

- **Web Build**: Isar has limitations on web due to JavaScript integer constraints. The current implementation uses Hive for web data persistence.
- **iOS PWA Icons**: Requires explicit cache clearing in Safari settings for icon updates to appear on home screen.

See [WEB_BUILD_NOTES.md](WEB_BUILD_NOTES.md) for web-specific considerations.

## Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
flutter test
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
flutter test --coverage
```
